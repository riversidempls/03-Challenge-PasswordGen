On page load I want a to see a popup box kind of slowly dissolve in on 
top of the current page content.

This new box could even use the same header text "Password Generator"
and button at the bottom is greyed out until all required parameters are entered.
Subtext "Select criteria for your new secure password."

no, just keep it simple and work with the criteria as written

1) page loads as is, user clicks "Generate Password" button and 
drop shadow appears to raise the box off the page.

2) Alert Prompts user with a series of questions.
    -"Choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters."
        textbox input with validation
    -"Include uppercase characters?"
        rocker switch input for Y/N 
    -"Include lowercase characters?"
        rocker switch input for Y/N
    -"Include numeric values?"
        rocker switch input for Y/N 
    -"Inclued special characters?"
        rocker switch input for Y/N 

    Need Validation to check at least one character type is selected.
    If not, prompt user.
    "At least one character type must be selected "yes".

    If validation passes, then the password is displayed and
    the alert window vanishes.


    Extras if time allows:

    1) Copy to clipboard button.
    2) Better styled alert window.
